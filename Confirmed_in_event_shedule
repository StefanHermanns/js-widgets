I am sorry... I have no idea if this is the right place and method. 
We raised a question and the colleague told us to write a ticket here. 

We are using the event shedule widget on our site. WBS offers the option to "confirm" a workshop and sent this information down the API. 
Unfortunatly this only works for the event page. How can we place this info in the shedule list?
